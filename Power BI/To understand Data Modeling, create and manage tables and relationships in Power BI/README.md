## Introduction

This guide helps you understand data modeling, create and manage tables, and establish relationships in Power BI, enabling effective data visualization and analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Introduction to Data Modeling

1. Understand basics of Entity-Relationship diagrams and various relationship measures.
2. Familiarize with the Power BI workspace.
3. Import sample data.

### Learn Data Modeling in Power BI

1. Understand data models in Power BI.
2. Create and manage relationships between data sources.
3. Configure table and column properties.
4. Create calculated columns and tables.
5. Create hierarchies.

### Create Quick Measures

1. Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create various expressions and filters.
2. Optimize data models.

### Create Visualization

1. Explore time-based data.

## Data Modeling

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams

Understand how to use Entity-Relationship diagrams to define how data sources are connected.

### Power BI Workspace

Get to know your Power BI workspace and its components.

### Importing Sample Data

1. Go to the `Get Data` option.
2. Select the data source you want to connect and click `Connect`.

## Creating and Managing Relationships

### Configuring Table and Column Properties

1. View column quality details.
2. Remove empty rows.
3. Use headers as the first row.

### Creating Calculated Columns and Tables

1. Create new columns such as `Total_Cost` and `Cost Level`.
2. Create hierarchies for better data organization.

### Creating Hierarchies

Organize related fields within a dataset to display one element ranked over others.

## Quick Measures and DAX

### Using DAX for Expressions and Filters

Leverage DAX for creating calculated columns, tables, and measures.

### Optimizing Data Models

Optimize data models for better performance and accuracy.

## Creating Visualizations

### Time-Based Data Exploration

Explore and visualize time-based data for better insights.

## Data Transformation Techniques

- Remove null values, duplicates, and errors.
- Replace values in columns.
- Extract components like month and year from date columns.
- Group data by specific attributes.
- Reverse rows and move columns.
- Sort data.

## Saving Your Work

Save and apply your changes from the Power Query Editor.

## Power BI Desktop Views

### Report View

Create compelling visualizations using your data queries.

### Data View

View and manage data in the report in data model format.

### Model View

Visualize and manage the relationships in your data model.

## Automatic Relationship Updates

Manage how Power BI treats and automatically adjusts relationships in your reports and models.

## Removing and Adding Relationships

### Removing Relationships

Right-click and select the "Delete" option to remove relationships.

### Adding Relationships

1. Select 'Manage Relationships' from the 'Home' tab.
2. Click and drag columns to create relationships.

## Using the Relate Function

Use the `RELATED` function to create related columns from different tables.

## Creating New Columns

Create columns like `Total_Cost`, `Cost Level`, and `Month ID` using DAX expressions.

## Creating Cards and Other Visuals

Create cards for key metrics such as the sum, max, count, and average of various columns.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on data modeling, creating and managing tables, and establishing relationships in Power BI, helping you create insightful visualizations.
